## About me and my goals with this

My name is [Pierre](https://github.com/splitpierre) and I have over 15 years of experience in full-stack development and entrepreneurship, specifically in web, mobile, and blockchain applications.

Recently, I began experimenting with OpenAI and was quickly drawn to its potential for creating niche-specialized AI-based applications. I am now seeking to build an infrastructure that can support a rapid roll-out of these applications.

If you want the stack open-sourced, consider [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/splitpierre) ;)
